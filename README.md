# Prolog-Chatbot

Our personal assistant is specifically built to help its users regarding what they could eat. The
assistant should give information about food ingredients, calories, and meals.
• The assistant receives questions from the user and answers them.
• The user gets back those answers and asks more questions, if he/she wants to.
• It can also receive information about the user, for example, what he/she had for a specific meal.
• In order to have a more intelligent agent, the chatbot should keep track of the previously asked
questions and responses.
• At the end, the assistant should print a report for the user about the food he/she ate during the
day.
